"""
Purpose: This script is to generate various combination of input parameters, stored as multiple csv files.
         Each file contains different environment and agent settings for 1 fire strategy.
         The generated input files are stored at "ABM-master/data/input/".

The Forestfire model takes 16 arguments as follows:
        height, width: The size of the grid to model; 100 predefined
        density: What fraction of grid cells have a tree in them; float with 2 digits range from (0.01, 1)
        temperature: influences the number of spontaneous fires; int range from [0,100]
        truck_strategy: the tactic that firetrucks will adhere to; 7 strategies str
        river_width: in the case that a river is present, what is its width; int range from 0-10
        break_width: in the case that a pre-made fire break is present, what is its width; int range from 0-10
        random_fires: boolean indicating whether spontaneous fires are present; boolean 0/1
        vision: the distance fire fighting agents can look around them; 100 predifined 
        truck_max_speed: the max speed with which firetruck agents can move around (grid cells/step); int 0-30
        wind_strength: the speed with which the wind moves; int 0-80 km/h
        wind_dir: string specifying the direction of the fire; 8 directions str
        sparse_ratio: the fraction of the vegetation that is sparse instead of dense; float with 1 digit 0-1
        steps_to_extinguishment: number of steps it takes for firetrucks to extinguish a burning cell; int 1-6 !!! TODO: check the meaning
        placed_on_edges: indicates whether the firetrucks are placed randomly over the grid, or equispaced on the rim; boolean 0/1
