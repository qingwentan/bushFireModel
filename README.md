ABM model is under folder "ABM-master". Run the ABM model by
'''
cd AMB-master
python src/main_model.py
'''
The 3 output files are under folder "ABM-master/src/test_data". 

TODO:
1. generate input csvsx
2. write automated code to run model by taking a input csv, and save output in a folder for each simulation Aanchal
3. figuring out the meaning of "steps to extinguishment" & truck "FUll" status
4. ask for permission for SPARTAN 
5. select 5 simulations to run 1000 times and compare result. (random_seed different setting), record the random seed; modify random seed of the model code.
